Simple sort algorithms in js

Been learning the algorithms on https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms/selection-sort

## Psuedocode
The psuedocode at the toptal site is a little weird, so here are my modified versions.  The notes are pulled mostly from the Toptal site and wikipedia.

### Insertion Sort
Basic Insertion Sort (inefficient)
```
for i = 2:n
  for (j=i; j>1 and (a[j] < a[j-1]); j--)
    swap a[j,j-1]
```
Slightly optimized Insertion Sort
```
for i = 2:n
  temp = a[i]
  j=i;
  for (j>1 and (a[j] < a[j-1]); j--)
    a[j] = a[j-1]
  a[j] = temp
```
Insertion sort works it's way up the list and when it finds a number that's too low, it pushes it down to where it should be and then keeps working up the list

Quirks of insertion sort:
- it starts at 2
- it's O(nÂ²), so it's pretty bad
- it's adaptive, so it actually runs fast (close to O(n)) when the list is almost sorted

### Selection Sort
```
for i = 1:n
  low = i
  for j = i+1:n
    if a[j] < a[low]
      low = j
  swap a[i,low]
```
Select sort finds the lowest number in the list and puts it in spot #1, then it finds the next lowest and puts it in spot #2 and so on.

Quirks of selection sort:
- it's O(nÂ²), so it's pretty bad
- it only does n swaps, so it's decent to use if the cost of swaps is high for some reason

### Bubble Sort
```
for i = 1:n
	swapped = false
	for j = n:i+1
		if (a[j] < a[j-1])
			swap a[j,j-1]
			swapped = true
		if (!swapped)
			break;
```
Bubble sort has an ascending outer loop, a boolean swapped variable and a descending inner loop.  The counter on the inner loop starts at the outer loop counter plus one because bubble sort swaps happen on the inner loop counter index and one element left of the counter.  The inner loop descends as long as the value left of the counter is greater than the counter and it will swap at each spot, if so.  With each increment of i, a[1..i] is properly sorted.
